          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and
            users of the <a href="http://lightdash.com/">Lightdash.com</a>{" "}
            hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or
            “Websites”) and self-managed installations, which are offered by
            Telescope Technology Inc. and/or any of its affiliates (“Lightdash”
            or “we” or “us”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By
            accessing or using any part of the Websites or self-managed
            installations, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent
            to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.
            Lightdash is an open source project and collaborative community, as
            well as a company. This means that many portions of our Websites,
            including information you voluntarily provide, will be public-facing
            for the open sharing of innovative developments, ideas, and
            information that makes our collaborative community so great. While
            we are committed to open sharing, we strive to respect the privacy
            of individual community members and will minimise the information we
            collect and share. If you do not want to share your information,
            including personally identifiable information, with other community
            members and the public, please be thoughtful as to how you interact
            with our Websites and what information you provide through the
            Websites (for example, through creating a public profile, project
            contributions, comments, and blog posts).
          </p>

          <h2>Data Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Oversight of Data Security is handled by Lightdash’s Data Protection
            Officer. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or
            additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by
            Lightdash, or if you have any general security concerns, please
            contact the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for your respective
            territory at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:support@lightdash.com">support@lightdash.com</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>What Information Lightdash Collects &amp; Why</h2>

          <h4>Information from Website Visitors</h4>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, Lightdash collects basic
            non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of the
            sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as
            the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
            and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to
            better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our
            Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of
            the Websites. From time to time, Lightdash may publicly release
            non-personally-identifying information collected from Website
            visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
            the usage of the Website. Lightdash also collects potentially
            personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses from visitors. Lightdash does not use such information to
            identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this
            information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve
            performance and content, and to monitor the security of the
            Websites. For logged-in users to Lightdash deployments, Lightdash
            tracks potentially personally-identifiable user behaviour on our
            application using our own software, to help us understand how to
            make the website more useful for different categories of user.
            Lightdash may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to
            our Websites. For instance, Lightdash may reveal how many downloads
            a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain
            anonymous user information only.
          </p>

          <h4>Usage Data Information from Self-managed Lightdash Instances</h4>
          <p>
            Lightdash collects information about usage from each self-managed
            Lightdash instance including feature usage and product version data.
            It is possible to opt out of personally identifiable information
            being transferred within the instance settings. Lightdash also
            tracks the usage of these instances at an aggregate level. We never
            collect information on the contents of your Lightdash projects,
            connection settings, database queries executed, or their results. It
            is also possible to prevent all tracking through modifying the code,
            which is made available to you.
          </p>
          <h4>Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
          <p>
            Users of the Websites may choose to interact with Lightdash in ways
            that provide us with their personally-identifying information. In
            some instances, a User ID is generated for form and url tracking,
            page views, page pings and usage counts in order to ascertain
            product performance and development. The amount and type of
            information that Lightdash gathers depends on the nature of your
            interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose
            to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our community
            Discourse group to provide a username and email address. We will
            also collect the information you provide with us in connection with
            creating an account on the Website. Profile information is shared
            publicly, as well as activity under your profile. If you report a
            security vulnerability to Lightdash and request public
            acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal
            information you provided to us in connection with the report,
            including your name to fulfil your request for acknowledgement. In
            each case, Lightdash collects such personally-identifiable
            information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil
            the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of Lightdash.
            We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than
            as described in this Privacy Policy. Visitors can always refuse to
            supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
            may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related activities
            or being able to access and use certain features and services.
          </p>

          <h4>Information Lightdash Does Not Collect</h4>
          <p>
            Lightdash does not collect sensitive personal information, such as
            social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or
            religious information. If you store any sensitive personal
            information on Lightdash’s servers, you are consenting to our
            storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the
            United States. If you’re a child under the age of 18, you may not
            have an account on the Website. Lightdash does not knowingly collect
            information from or direct any of our Website or content
            specifically to children under 18. If we learn or have reason to
            suspect that a user is under the age of 18, we will close the
            child’s account. Other countries may have different minimum age
            limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for
            data collection in your country, you may not use Lightdash.
          </p>
          <h4>Basis for Processing Your Information</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Performance of a contract.</strong> The use of your
            information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have
            with us. For example, if you use our Websites to purchase Lightdash
            product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project, create a
            profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request
            information through our Websites, we will use your information to
            carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or
            request. <strong>Legitimate interests.</strong> We use your
            information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you
            with the best content through our Websites and communications with
            users and the public, to improve and promote our products and
            services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and
            legal purposes. <strong>Consent.</strong> We may rely on your
            consent to use your personal information for certain direct
            marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about
            Lightdash products. You may withdraw your consent at any time
            through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email
            or by contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this
            Privacy Policy.

          <h2>
            How Lightdash Uses and Protects Personally-Identifying Information
          </h2>
          <h4>Sharing Your Information</h4>
          <p>
            Lightdash only discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information to those of its employees,
            contractors, and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on Lightdash’s behalf or to
            provide services available on the Website, and (ii) that have agreed
            not to disclose it to others. Please note, email and IP addresses of
            users of a Lightdash deployment may be shared with the respective
            users of that deployment. Lightdash will not rent or sell
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and
            affiliated organisations, as described above, Lightdash discloses
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only when required to do so by law, or when Lightdash
            believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
            protect the property or rights of Lightdash, third parties, or the
            public at large. Lightdash takes measures reasonably necessary to
            protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration, or
            destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lightdash at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where
            those companies are using the software that we provide. If you have
            concerns over the use of your logo, please email
            support@lightdash.com
          </p>

          <h4>International Transfer of Information</h4>
          <p>
            The Website is hosted in the United States and information we
            collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United
            States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that
            process information for us as described above may be located in the
            United States or in other countries outside of your home country; by
            using the Website, you consent to the international transfer of your
            information by Lightdash.
          </p>
          <h4>Lightdash Communications with You</h4>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your
            email address, Lightdash may occasionally send you an email to tell
            you about security, system information, new features, solicit your
            feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with
            Lightdash and our products. There’s an unsubscribe link located at
            the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you so you can
            stop receiving such emails at any time. If you send us a request
            (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
            mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order
            to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
            other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable
            information in connection with your request.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Do Not Track</h2>

          <h4>Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
            visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
            website each time the visitor returns. Lightdash uses cookies to
            help Lightdash identify and track visitors, their usage of the
            Websites, and their Website access preferences. Lightdash visitors
            who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set
            their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites.
            Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of Lightdash’s
            websites to not function properly. Certain pages on the Website may
            set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content,
            such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites
            set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over
            these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by
            our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h4>Tracking Technologies</h4>
          <p>
            We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these
            services to track you individually or collect your personally
            identifiable-information. We may use these services to collect
            information about how the Website performs and how users navigate
            through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our
            content and Website performance. Third-party tracking services
            gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over
            time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service
            provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data
            about your use of the Website. We do not link this information to
            any of your personal information such as your username.
          </p>
          <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
          <p>
            “Do Not Track” is a privacy preference you can set in your browser
            if you do not want online services to collect and share certain
            kinds of information about your online activity from third party
            tracking services. Lightdash does not track your online browsing
            activity on other online services over time and we do not permit
            third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our
            basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share
            this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of
            third party data collection for any of our users, and we do not
            track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to
            respond differently to an individual browser’s Do Not Track setting.
          </p>

          <h4>Global Privacy Practices</h4>
          <p>
            Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United
            States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we understand that
            users from other countries may have different expectations and
            rights with regard to their privacy. For all Website visitors and
            users, no matter their country of location, we will:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do

            </li>
            <li>
              only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the

            </li>
            <li>
              offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting
              your information that we have collected, with the exception of
              information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as
              is for the integrity of our project code as described further
              below; and
            </li>
            <li>
              provide Website users notice, choice, accountability, security,
              and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also
              provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.

          </ul>

          <h4>Data Retention and Deletion</h4>
          <p>
            If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access,
            update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by
            logging into your account and updating profile settings. Lightdash
            will retain your information for as long as your account is active
            or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you
            services through the Website, to comply with legal obligations,
            resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.
            Please note that due to the open source nature of our products,
            services, and community, we may retain limited
            personally-identifiable information indefinitely in order to ensure
            transactional integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you
            provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub
            issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have
            deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community
            posts. Also, as described in our Terms of Use, if you contribute to
            a Lightdash project and provide your personal information in
            connection with that contribution, that information (including your
            name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution
            and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would
            break the project code.
